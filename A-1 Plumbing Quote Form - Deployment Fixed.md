# A-1 Plumbing Quote Form - Deployment Fixed

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Original Problem**: The Manus deployment at https://eyvhvaid.manus.space/ was showing a chatbot interface instead of the quote request form.

**Root Cause**: The wrong application was deployed to the Manus space - it contained an A-1 Plumbing Assistant chatbot rather than the quote request form.

**Solution**: Recreated and deployed the correct quote request form from the GitHub Pages source.
