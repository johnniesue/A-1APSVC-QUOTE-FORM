# Investigation Findings

## Issue Summary
The user reported that the Manus deployment at https://eyvhvaid.manus.space/ is giving a 404 error when clicking on it, but the actual working site is at https://johnniesue.github.io/a1apsvc-request-quote-form/

## Actual Findings
- **Manus deployment (https://eyvhvaid.manus.space/)**: Shows an A-1 Plumbing Assistant chatbot interface, NOT a 404 error
- **GitHub Pages site (https://johnniesue.github.io/a1apsvc-request-quote-form/)**: Shows a comprehensive quote request form for A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services

## The Real Issue
The Manus deployment contains the wrong application - it has a chatbot instead of the quote request form. The user wants the quote request form deployed to the Manus space.

## Quote Form Structure (from GitHub Pages)
The form includes:
- Full Name (text input)
- Address (text input)
- Phone Number (text input)
- Email Address (text input)
- Property Type (dropdown: Residential/Commercial)
- Type of Issue (checkboxes): Leak, Clog, Water Heater, Toilet, Sewer Line, Other
- Describe the Problem (textarea)
- When did the problem start? (text input)
- Upload Photos (up to 5) (file input)
- Upload Video (optional) (file input)
- Access Notes (pets, gates, codes) (textarea)
- Best time to contact or schedule (text input)
- Submit Request button

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the GitHub Pages site's source code
2. Recreate the quote form application
3. Deploy it to replace the current Manus deployment
